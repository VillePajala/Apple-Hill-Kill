Apple Hill Kill is a short 3D game where the player can explore a 3D modeled house and "destroy" the building with ammunition. This short game is also developed during a game developement course. The main goals I was concentrating on:

* Building a 3D model of a real world house and importing it to Unity
* Gamifying the building (FPC)
* Coding a functional point counting system
* How to make object react when hit by something
