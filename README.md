# aPPLE hILL Kill
Apple Hill Kill is a short 3D game where the player can explore a 3D modeled house and "destroy" the building with ammunition.

The house is a real world building carefully modeled in scale with SketchUp and then imported to Unity. The game is short (only one level long) as it was never planned as a full scale game but rather to showcase basic skills in 3D modeling and game developement.
